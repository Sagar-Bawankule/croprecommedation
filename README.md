## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
# API Configuration
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
DEBUG=True

# External API Keys (Optional - services work without keys)
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
SOILGRIDS_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Database Configuration (Future)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./crops.db
```

### Frontend Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Backend Optimizations
- Async API calls for concurrent data fetching
- Response caching for frequently requested data
- Model loading optimization and memory management
- Database connection pooling (when implemented)

### Frontend Optimizations
- Component lazy loading for large datasets
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Image optimization and progressive loading
- Service worker for offline functionality

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- API key management and rotation
- User data privacy and GDPR compliance

## 🌍 Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Docker)
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Frontend Deployment
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy build/ directory to your hosting service
```

### Production Considerations
- Use production WSGI server (Gunicorn + Uvicorn)
- Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Set up SSL certificates
